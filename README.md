# Midterm Assignment (in-class)
You are in charge of making a p5js program that uses dynamically loaded data from Open Weather Mapâ€™s API to display graphics on a screen that react to the changing data. 

Working with you and a partner, coding side-by-side, complete the following:
1. Download the midterm-weather-example code from Github
2. Select three additional data points from the Open Weather Map API and display them as text on the screen. See https://openweathermap.org/current for the parameters returned from the API. 
3. Create a graphics element that will change as a result of the values returned from the API. Consider items like wind, humidity, cloud cover, and other items that may be interesting to view as information on screen. Start simple, then add to the code based on your success in getting your simple item to display. 
4. When finished, upload the work to Moodle in a ZIP archive under your name.
